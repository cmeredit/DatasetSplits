# Iris

This folder contains a train/test split for the [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).

A scaled version of the train/test split has also been provided. In this version, the entire dataset has been scaled to have values between 0 and 1, but the train/test split corresponds to the unscaled split (i.e., you're getting the same points, just scaled).
